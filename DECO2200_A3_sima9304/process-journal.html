                <p>In this semester, our team will design the project “Food Delivery”. Different from traditional food delivery, it delivers food for our customers with UAV and robots. Based on investigation, research and customer feedback, we observe that security problem is a main concern of the design. Most users worry whether the food could be delivered on time or whether they could fetch the food safely, as they feel afraid that the UAV might run across accidents in the delivery process or the food might be taken by others. Since the machine cannot determine the food is ordered by which customer, we accordingly discuss and solve the series of problems according to user feedback. In the process of investigation, we find that traditional food delivery service usually fails to guarantee the temperature of food and some users even complain that the food  received has been spilled. All of these problems affect the dining mood of customers. In addition, if the customer does not fetch food on time and the food delivery server is in a hurry to complete another order, he possibly places it at the door to ask the customer to take it back instead. Sometimes, when the customer arrives at home or goes to the door to fetch the food, the food has been already taken by others. As a result, we conceive a novel design totally different from traditional food delivery. To put it simply, our food delivery software offers two collection means, among which the first one is traditional food collection means and the second one is food collection means at the locker. Such design is particularly designed for people who order food but could not timely collect it. Users could choose appropriate collection means after payment. </p>

                <p> As per relevant online research, I find that robot and UAV food delivery service is already available but not universal till now. I learn through the investigation that Domino Company specializes in the production of food delivery UAV and robot which are able to calculate the fastest way to customer address and monitor the delivery process via the equipped camera. The robot will automatically send the food collection  code  to customers and customers could only successfully unlock the locker to get the pizza after inputting fixed  code. Therefore, I consider that the security problem could be solved at all. As indicated by online questionnaire results, most people prefer to order food via phone software and they place great emphasis on the delivery speed. The interview and affinity digram suggest that 88% people order food with phone software and 51% people would like to try unmanned food delivery service.</p>

                <p> In the second assignment, one of our concepts comes from Post office locker and Hive box locker. Both of the two lockers are free of charge and placed at the community or apartment downstairs. People could open the locker to fetch the luggage by inputting message security code  at any time. 

                As for the subject color of this app, we choose yellow for #FFC478 and 100% red +78.04％ green+28.24％blue for #FFC748. The reason why we choose the color as the subject color is because yellow stands for freshness and clarity. The research shows that bright yellow is a very conspicuous color. The combination of yellow and black is one of the color combinations which enable people to most easily observe and read from the far distance. This also explains why we choose yellow as the subject color. Concerning our app interface design, we refer to some APP design websites, such as Pinterest. 

                In terms of the selection of font, we choose Montserrat as the body font and choose Montserrat alternative as the title font. Montserrat was made by an Argentinian designer named Julieta Ulanovsky in an attempt to “rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century.”  It’s geometric, it’s got a unique flair to it that makes it not as neutral or overly familiar as many neo-grotesque fonts like Univers or Helvetica. In consequence, we choose it as our app font. </p>

                <p>Product usability is an important part of user research. For this reason, we conduct user research in every stage during the design process. The research before the initial design is developed to learn about the needs of target group. The purpose of testing in the initial stage of design is to guarantee users have normal experience and every subsequent testing aims to make the product design more perfect.The following few methods have been used in our user research. In view of the advantages and disadvantages of each research method, I choose some methods useful to my product research.  </p>

                <p>The first method is online questionnaire which has an advantage in the fast collection of considerable data feedback and useful statistics. While the disadvantage of the method consists in its inability to have deep insights into consumer needs.</p> 

                <p>The second method is interview. Such method is in one-to-one communication form with user. The time of interview varies from user to user within the range of 10-30 min. The interview method enables me to deeply learn about more thoughts, suggestions, experience and feelings of users.Then I also completed the affinity digram </p>

                <p>The third method is user testing which has been applied in each design stage. During the testing process, we would know users’ confusion about product use and write down unclear points in the notebook. Moreover, after testing, we also inquire users of their improvement opinions for products.</p>

                <p>First of all, we do the research report in the first assignment. I have employed many different methods in the investigation research, such as online research, online questionnaires, interviews, affinity digram, persona and storyboard, etc. In line with interview feedback, I find that overwhelming users are very interested in UAV food delivery since they consider it as a novel food delivery means that they have never tried before. Additionally, they hold the opinion that it is faster and more convenient than traditional food delivery means by saving traffic congestion and traffic light awaiting time. </p>

                <p>The second assignment requires group cooperation. At the beginning of group discussion, we merge the ideas of the first assignment. After negotiation, we derive two relatively satisfactory concepts. The first concept is to send food to destination and even precise window by UAV so that users could fetch the food at the window of home without any need of going downstairs. The second concept is also to deliver food by UAV. However, we design locker for food. When users could not timely go downstairs to fetch the food, the food will be delivered by UAV to the food locker for heat preservation or cooling. </p>

                <p>After completing the hand-sketch of the two concepts, we respectively carry out a user testing with ten users and obtain feedback. 

                The advantage of the first concept is that online payment could save more time and timely track order state, while corresponding disadvantage is that website icons possibly confuse users. Moreover, users consider it dangerous and troublesome to input the security code on UAV screen. Once inputting erroneous security code, users possibly take more time in food delivery. 

                The advantage of the second concept is that locker design creates great convenience for those people who cannot timely fetch food. It is a creative idea to log in the app by phone number and verification code. Regarding the disadvantage of the concept, users consider that inputting security code  is not as convenient as scanning  QR code. Besides, users feel it tiring when they are required to go downstairs to fetch food and apart from it, users actually demand more search buttons. 

                By way of user testing, we obtain numerous good feedback. Consequently, we combine two concepts to form the final concept. </p>

                <p>Our final concept has been adjusted to a large extent, which could be proven by low-fidelity prototype. First of all, we redesign the icons and replace the security code food collection means with QR code scanning means. In this way, users just need to take out the phone to scan the screen and take food from UAV or locker. According to user feedback, we find potential dangers caused by inputting security code means, for the reason that people need to get close to UAV to press the code. We worry that users might be injured by the rotary propeller of UAV while inputting code. For fear of any accidents, we replace the security code with QR code scanning. Our initial design plans to give every user a special QR code. However, after deliberate consideration, we decide to change QR code into a random one so that users would get a new food collection QR code after placing order. We worry that fixed QR code would be misappropriated. As for locker design, our idea is from Post office locker and Hive box locker. Both of the two lockers are  free of charge and placed at the community or apartment downstairs. People could open the locker to fetch the luggage by inputting message security code at any time. These available designs stimulate our inspiration. Therefore, I design a locker specifically proper for our product. Different from traditional locker, our locker adds cooling and heat preservation functions so that the food could maintain temperature before collection.</p>
                <p>With regard to logo design, it is also the UAV designed by us for the product. As shown by the picture, UAV has a “big eye”. It is actually a camera which allows users to timely track and monitor the order. The joints connecting the box seem like two hands grasping food heat preservation box. On the surface of box, there has a square screen used for scanning QR code. When users scan the screen with phone, the locker will be unlocked automatically and users could take food out of the box. After designing the low-fidelity prototype, we respectively develop user testing with ten users and seek their feedback. </p>

                <p>I consider UAV food delivery as a very good choice because it could send food to customers at the fastest speed and ensure that the food still preserves its temperature before collection. In my view, UAV food delivery is more faster and convenient than traditional food delivery. Under constant improvement of our group, our app is different from traditional food delivery app. Users are able to choose proper food collection means after paying for the order and randomly change it five minutes before the arrival of UAV. On the other hand, users could track the website to check their orders and UAV food delivery progress. As long as the food approaches the destination, the app will remind users that the UAV has arrived at designated destination and users just need to click the screen to confirm the information. I think that it is a great design. During this product design, I think that the multi-functional website of this app still has a limitation in color matching. However, despite repeated change of color transparency and depth, I still fail to produce satisfactory effects. More importantly, if time permitted, we should pay more attention to user testing since we could obtain more feedback from more user testing. </p>
